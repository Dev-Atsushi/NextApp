# Getting the code

As a prerequisite, it is necessary to install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) in its LTS version.

With these applications installed, open the terminal in the folder of your choice. Then, run the following commands, in sequence:

### Execute

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/Dev-Atsushi/NextApp.git
cd NextApp
```

### Windows / Mac / Linux:

```zsh
npm install
#or
yarn
```

### Start the server:

```zsh
npm start dev
#or
yarn start
```
